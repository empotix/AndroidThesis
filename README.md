Abstract
=============

Development of their processing power and memory capacities of mobile devices have brought chance to detect global location of devices over wireless networks, cellular networks and Global Positioning System (GPS). Via the usage of positioning technology business are enabled to provide Location Based Systems to track movement and delivers valuable information from web services. There are several geometric principles for location estimation such as Triangulation, Trilateration, and Multilateration. Along with these principles there are several techniques and limitations according to its indoor and outdoor usage.
All these technological opportunities have broadened the variety of mobile applications which are based on location data. Nowadays, these types of applications plays important roles for businesses such as services about social life or services for governments. Shortly, location based services determines location, transmit this location data, and receive information from web service.
New generation android devices with its embedded signal receiver have enabled to use location service, mobile maps, and data communication infrastructure to transmit location data to web services. This research will introduce you the architecture and component model of Android Applications including activities, intent receivers, services, and content providers on the system established on Linux kernel and Android runtime which includes Dalvik Virtual Machine and Android Libraries. Background of Location Manager on android devices, integration to map application of location manager, Geocoding, 3D topographical tracking, Handling Location Errors, Providers and Accuracy are some another fields which thesis are established on. Besides thesis research are demonstrated with a business application developed by Java and XML.

Application
=============

One of the biggest challenges of the brands is to attract potential customers to the point of sales and to increase the conversion rates. The Application developed for the thesis is a location based mobile coupon platform where mobile users can reach discounts and deals of the brands in the most convenient way; and where brands can make campaigns with advanced targeting options in order to increase sales and customer portfolio. In spite of the difficulty to pull potential customers in shop, mobile coupons increase sales conversion. 
Mobile coupon applications are an effective channel to detect that customer is at the point of sale, before the transaction. Therefore, a mobile application is implemented at the implementation stage of the study. The reason to implement such type of an application is that to send location data on the server part, to match these data with the current shop location and coupons and give a response accordingly. However, the distinction is to require the user to be on the location and therefore to provide better coupon redemption performances check. There are coupon applications available on the market, nevertheless check-in process can be made in every place rather than the exact coupon location, and eliminate the main functionality which is to attract the customers to the point of sales. To include location into marketing strategies as a dimension enables brands to have much more semantic results. Via the application, coupons are sent to the users which are filtered by location data, retrieved from GPS and mobile operators. On map interface, users can see how far they are to the shops which offer coupons, as well as register their favorite brands and shops and interact with them.
